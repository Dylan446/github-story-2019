<h1>Chapter 3 - How We can Reduce Global Warming, and stop the Early Spring</h1>

<p>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
 The list of things you could do at home to have a bigger impact on the environment than you think
 is endless. Things such as driving fuel efficient cars, maintaining your car, using public transport
 less, and reducing your usage of fossil fuels can have a great impact on the environment. If everyone
 made a concious effort to do even some of these things, it would have a great effect on global warming,
 and preventing the occurance of an Early Spring, which would negatively impact animals and plant life
 around the world.
