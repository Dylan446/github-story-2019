<h1>Chapter 2 - The Impacts of an Early Spring</h1>

<p>
  New studies show that if the current levels of greenhouse
  gas emissions continue, leaves will appear an average of
  21 days earlier by 2100. Plants an animals instinctively
  react to the seasonal rise and decline in temperatures, and
  the increased amount of daylight that comes in spring. Global warming
  will distort this rise and decline, as well as the daylight pattern
  which will have a knock on effect on not only the environment, but <thead>
    economy.
<br><br>
    Warmer and earlier springs can cause plants to bloom earlier than before,
    change the locations of migrating species as a result of varying temperatures
    in their current locations, alter the hibernation patterns of animals and
    increase seasonal insect populations. As a result of all of this,
    plants can bloom before their pollinators such as bees and wasps are
    available, and as a result of increased insect populations, aggresive insects
    can cause damage to food crops. These effects can threaten the aggricultural
    market which could in turn result in an increased food price, or even a complete
    lack of food.
<br><br>
    It could also have a great effect on allergies. This year in Germany the pollen levels
    were at a record high for February since 1985. The reason for the unusually high levels
    of pollen is down to the plants across the country mistakenly believing winter had come to its
    natural end as a result of this "Early Spring".
