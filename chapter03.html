<h1>Chapter 3 - How We can Reduce Global Warming, and stop the Early Spring</h1>

<p>
  Reducing global warming and healing the planet starts in your garage,
  kitchen and dining room table. Home temperature regulation is one of <thead>
    biggest uses of energy. It equates for around half of home energy use alone.
    You can help this by ensuring there is no drafts, and also ensuring that your
    home is adequately insulated so there is no loss of heat which results in using
    more energy to keep the place warm. Energy efficiency is the lowest cost way to
    reduce emissions. It would even save you money. Another way to help with energy
    usage is when shopping for new household appliances, check the labels to find
    which appliance is most energy efficient.
<br><br>
 Although you might not think it, saving on your water usage can reduce carbon pollution.
 It takes alot of energy to pump, heat and treat your water. If you take shorter showers,
 turn off the tap while you are brushing your teeth, and use more water-efficient appliances
 you could be making a decent impact on the environment.
<br><br>
 Other simple stuff you could do at home is use energy saving lightbulbs. They're cheaper to
 run, and will also benefit the environment. Make sure to plug out devices from your electricity
 outlets when they are not in use.
<br><br>
 The list of things you could do at home to have a bigger impact on the environment than you think
 is endless. Things such as driving fuel efficient cars, maintaining your car, using public transport
 less, and reducing your usage of fossil fuels can have a great impact on the environment. If everyone
 made a concious effort to do even some of these things, it would have a great effect on global warming,
 and preventing the occurance of an Early Spring, which would negatively impact animals and plant life
 around the world.
