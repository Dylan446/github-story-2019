<h1>Chapter 1 - Global warming and "The Early Spring"</h1>

<p>
  Global warming has been a big topic of conversation in recent times.
  Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's
  near-surface air and the oceans ever since the mid-twentieth century and
  its projected continuation. One of the talked about effects of global warming
  is being referred to as "The Early Spring". As a result of the increase in
  minimum temperatures and the overall warming, there has been a lengthening
  of the warm season, which for plants and wildlife etc is the growing season.
  Many plants and animals respond to this longer season by adjusting their timings
  of activities that are usually associated with spring, such as the leaves flowering,
  leaves falling, as well as breeding and bird migration. It is believed that the Spring
  onset is occuring 10-16 days earlier than before, and will shift a further 23 days over
  the coming century. This has a knock on effect which means shorter winters, which may sound
  good to us, but completely effects the natural balance of plants and wildlife around the world.
